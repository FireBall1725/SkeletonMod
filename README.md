# Skeleton Mod

## Usage
The Skeleton Mod includes a gradle task so that you do not have to manually refactor packages/class names & directory structures etc.

Run the gradle task or BASH script and follow the instructions printed on the console, delete the .git folder and you're good to go!

Mod ID will default to a trimmed and lowercase version of your mod name. So you can leave that blank, unless you want something else.

Base Package defaults to "com.fireball1725" for her own usage, so you should ALWAYS change this.

Note: BASH script is left included for those who with to use it.
