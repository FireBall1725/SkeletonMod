# Skeleton Mod

## Usage
You can use the provided setup script (written in BASH, so Windows users will need CyGwin or something similar to use it).

Run the setup script and follow the instructions printed on the console, delete the .git folder and you're good to go!

Mod ID will default to a trimmed and lowercase version of your mod name. So you can leave that blank, unless you want something else.

Base Package defaults to "com.fireball1725" for her own usage, so you should ALWAYS change this.
